Reinforcement Learning on OpenAI Gym’s LunarLander-v2 using policy gradients. Includes complete understanding, trials, exploration logs, and visualizations.


# 🛰️ Reinforcement Learning: OpenAI LunarLander Trials

This repository documents my first real project with Reinforcement Learning, focusing on **OpenAI Gym's LunarLander-v2** environment. This is not just a plug-and-play repo — it reflects my process of learning **every line**, **every method**, and **why** it works.

## 🎯 Goal

To understand and implement **Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning** and apply it to make an AI agent learn how to land a spacecraft safely between two flags.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How rewards are assigned and how they shape the learning process.
- Why we use **discounted rewards** and how `gamma` affects learning.
- What the **policy gradient** method actually does mathematically and practically.
- Why randomness (exploration) in action selection early in training is important.
- How to debug bad learning outcomes (agent always crashes or drifts away).
- How to visualize improvement by watching episodes.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- ✔️ A working policy gradient agent built with TensorFlow/Keras
- ✔️ Multiple training trials with different configurations
- ✔️ Failures included — not just the final result
- ✔️ Rendered videos showing success and failure
- ✔️ Clear folder structure for reproducibility
